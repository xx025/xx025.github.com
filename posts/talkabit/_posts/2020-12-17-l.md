Sometimes i am vary sad, bitter and regretful for some things I have done. Yes, I have a low self-esteem, but that's only at times, more often I am a proud and conceited person...  

And else some people play tricks on me, yeah "dance big sword in front of Guan Gong". Readers of "The Art of Deception", although it has been a long time ago, I at least remember something.
